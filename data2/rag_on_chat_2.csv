User: Hi there, I've been having issues with property registration at sub-registrar office 575 using the tnreginet.gov.in portal. The sub-registrar has been conducting money transfers very sneakily without the knowledge of RBI. Would you be able to help?

Bot: I'm sorry to hear about this. I'm here to assist you. Could you tell me more about the problem you're facing during this registration process? [Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)]

User: The sub-registrar and both the buyer and seller have come together to transfer the money without the knowledge of the RBI as if it's a banking service done in the Affidavit alone. These deeds are written recorded but there's been no link made from the TNREGINET website to RBI, IT Pan website, or Aadhar until now.

Bot: I see, that's quite a serious issue. So, you're saying that the sub-registrar is conducting the money transactions without being under the control of RBI, right? [Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax) -> Direct Taxes]

User: Yes, exactly. The money transfers are done in a way that appears as if they are within the rules to avoid detection by the RBI. And, all this is causing a government tax evasion.

Bot: That's quite a significant complaint. Could you please provide me the regional office where this issue occurred for rendering a proper complaint against it? [Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax) -> Direct Taxes -> Information about Benami Transaction]

User: Yes, it's the 575 Sub-registrar office.
